CheckValve Console Relay
========================

**The CheckValve Console Relay is still under development and may contain bugs!**

The CheckValve Console Relay allows client devices such as mobile phones to receive
console messages from HLDS/SRCDS servers.  It is a cross-platform program developed
in Java, which basically does three things:

1. Listens for connection requests from client devices
2. Listens for log messages coming from HLDS/SRCDS servers
3. Relays the log messages to connected clients
